<section class= "main">According to science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, a global timequake will occur in New York City on 13th February 2001. It is the moment when the universe suffers a crisis of conscience. Should it expand or make a great big bang? It decides to wind the clock back a decade to 1991, making everyone in the world endure ten years of deja-vu and a total loss of free will - not to mention the torture of reliving every nanosecond of one of the tawdiest and most hollow decades. With his trademark wicked wit, Vonnegut addresses memory, suicide, the Great Depression, the loss of American eloquence, and the obsolescent thrill of reading books.

<section><p class="container">1.For my first image I drawn the characters out I did this because one of the scenes his kids call him junior I found this scene peculiar as I didn't understand why they called him junior.And because of that I wanted to display most of his children saying that also on this image I started the sketch off so I didn't do that much detail however I did add crease lines on there clothing just to add a bit of raw texture.</p>

<section class="container">2.This following drawing shows one of the scientists at a speech meeting talking about not making bombs of mass destruction so I tried to capture that by making it look like he is raising his fist like a rights revolution this made the drawings point come across more easier as it shows that if he does this it could result in him getting in trouble for speaking out of term.with this drawing is started out by drawing the stairs then I did the podium after I shaded in the scientist then I added some 3d elements to the stairs then shaded the parts where less light would be to make it look accurate I then shaded in the podium just make the</p

<section class="main">3.This first sketch is a one of the scenes from chapter 2 and this scene talks about Germany and japan at war so because of that phrase war I versioned tanks and I also tried to make japan tank look better mainly because in those times japan still had good technology towards other countries.when it comes to the drawings them selves I started by drawing out the tanks and then I started to apply more detail so I put the guns up and then I added some shadows to give the tank more texture.I even added darker shades on the parts of the tank where the lighting would be decreased this made the drawing look better.</section><br></div>

<section< class="main"> 4.I drew this scene from the book because there was interesting part where the Germans are going to release an atom bomb into Hiroshima so I sketched out the plain first this lead me to draw the bomb it self. Moreover I started drawing the landscape of the city so a draw the houses so I put all of the features like the windows and Japanese sliding doors in the end I shaded it all in to give more stronger detail.</section>
