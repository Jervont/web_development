<section class= "main">According to science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, a global timequake will occur in New York City on 13th February 2001. It is the moment when the universe suffers a crisis of conscience. Should it expand or make a great big bang? It decides to wind the clock back a decade to 1991, making everyone in the world endure ten years of deja-vu and a total loss of free will - not to mention the torture of reliving every nanosecond of one of the tawdiest and most hollow decades. With his trademark wicked wit, Vonnegut addresses memory, suicide, the Great Depression, the loss of American eloquence, and the obsolescent thrill of reading books.

<section class="container">This following drawing shows one of the scientists at a speech meeting talking about not making bombs of mass destruction so I tried to capture that by making it look like he is raising his fist like a rights revolution this made the drawings point come across more easier as it shows that if he does this it could result in him getting in trouble for speaking out of term.with this drawing is started out by drawing the stairs then I did the podium after I shaded in the scientist then I added some 3d elements to the stairs then shaded the parts where less light would be to make it look accurate I then shaded in the podium just make the end result look right. </section>
